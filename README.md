# skiql

skiql is a small python package for running a bunch of SQL files. This is to solve that issue where you have a lot of SQL files for functions, views, stored procedures and whatever else, you change the name of a column in a single table, then you need to follow that the whole way through and make sure everything has been synced up. So why not just run everything.

## Installation

Open a terminal in this directory and run `py -m pip install .` to install.

## Usage

Command line options etc.
Should I set up configuration files? Check how eg SQLFluff does it?
